# Boundary element method implementation for the Helmholtz equation using constant tridimensional triangular elements

# Module for the constant three-dimensional triangular element
# Contains the dependencies for the triangular element integration. The main function is const3D_tri.solve() which builds the influence matrices, applies the boundary conditions, solves the linear system and returns the value of the velocity potential and its flux at boundary and domain points.
