# BlenderBEM
This is a Blender addon to solve boundary element method equations using Python.

To use this tool, some libraries like numpy and numba must be installed in Blender's python. I advice using pip to install them.

For python, you'll need Numpy and SciPy. Install them using pip with the Blender Python executable.

For Julia, you'll need PyCall,SpecialFunctions, KrylovMethods and Distributed.
Also, you'll need to include the Julia path into the PATH.

Demo of the tool can be seen here:
